# CV Application

### [Live Demo](https://4c-75-63-6b-79.github.io/CV_Application/)

This is first assignment for learning React under The Odin Project. The main purpose for this assignment was to learn about the state and props in React. I tried my best to familiarize my self with the state and props and the basics of the React. I also tried to implement the form validation to best of my capabilites. The styling I did in the project is very basic and not very responsive. Since I am not very good at making things look I took the help from this [submission](https://michalosman.github.io/cv-application/) for the same assignment.
